# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
## 1. Js Variables
### You discussed about var, let, and const. With var and let you can change the value that is declared on it, example var/let Cs = 1; then you made it Cs = Cs + 1; Cs becomes 2 instead of 1. On the other hand if its const Cs = 1; you can't change it even if you add, subtract, multiply or divide.
## 2. Data Types
### In class we learned about the different types of Data types which are String, Number, Boolean, String represents data that contains texxt you can use double quote (" ") or single quote (' '). Number there can be decimal which is a float or an integer. Boolean is usually true or false, it is used to check if two variables are the same or not. 
## 3. Js Operation
### Theres are 4 types or operator that was discussed
## 4. Arithmetic Operators, Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, and Assignment Operators. You can use Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulus for Arithmetic Operators. You can use Comparison Operators with ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <= to see the difference of the two variables. You can use Logical operators with these: &&(and), ||(or), and !(not). Assignment Operators there are 6 which are =, +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=.
###
## 5. Commonly Used JavaScript Number Objects
### We learned about Nan, Number. Where Nan means "not a number" which is because you tried to use a non numeric into a numeric number. With Number it just converts values into numbers for example you put Number with the string "67" instead of being a string it becomes 10.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 
## 1. Functions
### I still don't understand fully about functions since the stucture is confusing. Just like the LT last september 16 I didnt use functions and I used loops since it was more comfortable to me. I think the most confusing part is calling the function and the structure.
## 2. VsCode
### There are still a lot of extensions we can explore. We could use Code Runner since it uses programmiing languages like Phython, Java, C++, and what we are learning right now JavaScript. There are also still some confusing parts with vscode just like the debug console you might not understand what it meant
## 3. Github
### since like there are some parts in there that are confusing like whats a blame.
## 4. Function using the return statement
### Since I usually get confused on where to put the return statement
## 5. Markdown
### Maybe because I didn't learn it properly
# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
### For me I would probably try searching in the internet with questions about coding. I usualy use W3School as practice since its easy to read.
# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
## Effective
### 1. Kahoot
## since it helps us to try our bet to be the first one
### 2. Speed Test
## since it makes our mind trying to lock in for the bonus points
## Ineffective
### 1. Long Lectures
## since sometimes we lose our focus on the lecture
### 2. 2nd Graded Excercise
## since we barely changed anything in the graded Excercise
